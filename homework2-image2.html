    <h1>Homework 2 Image 2</h1>

    <p> I picked this spot because it shows how nature and the city blend together. The mix of trees and tall structures makes the city feel alive. By changing the hue and saturation, I turned the natural colors of trees into warm fall tones along with black and white vibes mixed with pink to give the photo a dreamy, other-worldly feeling instead of a regular city view. </p>
