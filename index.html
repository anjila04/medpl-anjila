<p>My name is Anjila Raya, and I’m majoring in Emerging Media with a strong interest in design and visual storytelling. I'm just starting to learn tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and HTML, and I’m excited about how they can support my creative ideas. My work is inspired by modern design trends, everyday experiences, and how media can influence the way we see the world. As I continue to grow in this field, I aim to develop both my technical skills and creative thinking to produce work that is engaging, thoughtful, and impactful.</p>
