    <h1>Homework 2 Image 1</h1>

    <p>I chose this place because the buildings and streets make strong lines that lead our eyes to the middle. The photo feels balanced because the buildings are on both sides. I changed the hue, saturation, and lightness to make the colors look green and pink to make it look more creative and different.
